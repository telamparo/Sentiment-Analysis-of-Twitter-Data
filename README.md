# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Using data extracted from Twitter, another student and I completed a sentiment analysis of Apple and Samsung products. We drew a comparison between the two brands by evaluating polarity, retweet count, subjectivity, location, and device source. We first extracted the data using Python code which was completed in Jupyter Notebook. After identifying, extracting, cleaning, and preprocessing the data that was exported to a CSV file, we created 4 visualizations in Tableau that were incorporated into the written analysis of our findings. We analyzed the relationship between subjectivity and polarity, a map of the extracted tweets colored by brand, the relationship between polarity and subjectivity versus retweet count, and the polarity of tweets based on device source.
